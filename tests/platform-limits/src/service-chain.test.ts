/**
 * Service-binding chain audit.
 *
 * On the Workers Free plan a request gets 50 subrequests and, on either plan,
 * a hard cap of 32 worker invocations. Every service-binding hop spends one of
 * each. Worse for the free tier, CPU time is summed across the whole chain and
 * billed as one request — so chain depth is what makes the CPU cost of a route
 * unknowable, and it is the one part of that cost measurable from the repo
 * alone.
 *
 * What this suite does NOT claim: that the longest chain is what any real
 * request walks. It is a static upper bound over the bindings a worker
 * declares, not a trace. A route eight workers deep is not necessarily over
 * 10ms — but nothing in the repo can tell you it is under, and a bound that
 * grows silently is how you find out in production.
 *
 * See specs/profiles/free-tier.md, "The chained-CPU constraint".
